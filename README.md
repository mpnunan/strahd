```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## development notes
* issues are organized by milestone
* there is no preferred order for issue completion
  - many of the "campaign information" issues and "user interactions and admin editability" issues can be worked on simultaneously
